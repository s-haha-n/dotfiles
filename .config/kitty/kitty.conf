cursor_trail 1
#Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a “cursor trail” animation. This is an animation that shows a “trail” following the movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds. The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is started.
