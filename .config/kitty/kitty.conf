#Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a “cursor trail” animation. This is an animation that shows a “trail” following the movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds. The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is started.

#Understanding Kitty's Color Table in Simple Terms
#
#Your kitty.conf snippet shows the 16 standard ANSI colors (8 dull, 8 bright) that terminals have supported for decades. These are the colors that applications like ls (when it uses LS_COLORS), grep --color=auto, vim (in terminal mode), and many command-line utilities use when they output colored text.
#
#Here's what each colorN and colorN_ pair in your kitty.conf corresponds to in terms of standard ANSI escape codes, and thus what kind of terminal output they will affect:
#
#    color0 / color8 (Black / Bright Black)
#        color0: The "normal" black (ANSI 30 for foreground, 40 for background). This is often your terminal's background color.
#        color8: The "bright black" or "dark grey" (ANSI 90 for foreground, 100 for background). Often used for comments or less important text in terminal applications.
#
#    color1 / color9 (Red / Bright Red)
#        color1: The "normal" red (ANSI 31 / 41). Commonly used for errors, warnings, or deletion highlights.
#        color9: The "bright red" (ANSI 91 / 101). Often used for more urgent errors or bold red text.
#        ls uses this for: Hard links (sometimes), archive files (.zip, .tar.gz), sometimes broken symlinks.
#
#    color2 / color10 (Green / Bright Green)
#        color2: The "normal" green (ANSI 32 / 42). Often used for success messages, added lines in diffs, or executable files.
#        color10: The "bright green" (ANSI 92 / 102).
#        ls uses this for: Executable files.
#
#    color3 / color11 (Yellow / Bright Yellow)
#        color3: The "normal" yellow (ANSI 33 / 43). Often used for warnings or modified lines.
#        color11: The "bright yellow" (ANSI 93 / 103).
#        ls uses this for: Character devices, block devices.
#
#    color4 / color12 (Blue / Bright Blue)
#        color4: The "normal" blue (ANSI 34 / 44). Used for directories, often in ls.
#        color12: The "bright blue" (ANSI 94 / 104).
#        ls uses this for: Directories (this is the one you changed earlier), sometimes FIFO pipes.
#
#    color5 / color13 (Magenta / Bright Magenta)
#        color5: The "normal" magenta (ANSI 35 / 45).
#        color13: The "bright magenta" (ANSI 95 / 105).
#        ls often uses this for: Image files (.jpg, .png), video files (.mp4, .avi), audio files (.mp3, .wav). This is the one you asked about for .mp4!
#
#    color6 / color14 (Cyan / Bright Cyan)
#        color6: The "normal" cyan (ANSI 36 / 46).
#        color14: The "bright cyan" (ANSI 96 / 106).
#        ls often uses this for: Symbolic links (symlinks).
#
#    color7 / color15 (White / Bright White)
#        color7: The "normal" white or light grey (ANSI 37 / 47). Often your default foreground text color.
#        color15: The "bright white" or pure white (ANSI 97 / 107). Often used for bold or highlighted default text.
#
#In essence:
#
#When ls (or any other program) wants to show a directory, it sends an ANSI code like \033[34m (for normal blue) to the terminal. Kitty receives this code and then renders the text that follows using the color value you've assigned to color4 in your kitty.conf. If it sends \033[94m (for bright blue), Kitty uses color12. The same applies to video files using color5 or color13.
#
#So, you don't directly tell Kitty "make directories blue." You tell Kitty "when I receive the ANSI code for 'dull blue', use this specific hex color (#0d73cc) to render it."
